# Day 1

- Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- Open up [Solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)
- Go through `01_Storage.sol` & `02_Owner.sol` (can paste commented version into Remix)
- Create `ProtoPoap.sol` (start at `ProtoPoapTodo.sol`)
- Go through `WETH9.sol` (the wrapped eth contract) as homework
